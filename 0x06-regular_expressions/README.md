# # Regular Expressions in Shell

## Overview

This README file provides a brief introduction to regular expressions in the context of shell scripting. Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are powerful patterns used for matching character combinations within strings. In shell scripting, regular expressions are commonly employed with commands like `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, and others to search, filter, or manipulate text.

## Basic Concepts

### 1. Metacharacters

Metacharacters are special characters with a reserved meaning in regular expressions. Some common metacharacters include:

- `.` (dot): Matches any single character.
- `*` (asterisk): Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character.
- `+` (plus): Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character.
- `?` (question mark): Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding character.
- `[]` (square brackets): Defines a character class. Matches any single character within the brackets.
- `()` (parentheses): Groups expressions together.

### 2. Anchors

Anchors are used to specify the position of a match within the text:

- `^` (caret): Matches the beginning of a line.
- `$` (dollar sign): Matches the end of a line.

### 3. Quantifiers

Quantifiers specify the number of occurrences of a character or a group:

- `{n}`: Matches exactly n occurrences.
- `{n,}`: Matches n or more occurrences.
- `{n,m}`: Matches between n and m occurrences.

## Examples

### 1. Basic Matching

```sh
echo "Hello World" | grep "World"
```

This command searches for the pattern "World" in the string "Hello World."

### 2. Character Classes

```sh
echo "123-456-7890" | grep "[0-9]\{3\}-[0-9]\{3\}-[0-9]\{4\}"
```

This command validates a phone number pattern using a character class and quantifiers.

### 3. Anchors

```sh
echo "Start of the line" | grep "^Start"
```

This command checks if the string starts with "Start."

## Conclusion

Regular expressions are a versatile tool in shell scripting for text manipulation and pattern matching. Understanding the basic concepts and syntax empowers scriptwriters to efficiently process and filter text data within the shell environment.
