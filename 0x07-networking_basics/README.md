# Networking Basics #0

In this project, we delve into the fundamental concepts of networking. By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of various networking components and protocols without relying on external sources like Google. Let's dive into the learning objectives:

## OSI Model
- **What it is:** The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstract layers.
- **How many layers it has:** The OSI Model comprises seven layers.
- **How it is organized:** The layers are organized hierarchically, each layer performing specific functions while interacting with adjacent layers.

## LAN (Local Area Network)
- **Typical usage:** LANs are commonly used in home networks, small offices, or buildings to connect devices within a limited area.
- **Typical geographical size:** LANs typically cover a small geographical area, such as a single building or campus.

## WAN (Wide Area Network)
- **Typical usage:** WANs are utilized to connect LANs over long distances, often spanning cities, countries, or even continents.
- **Typical geographical size:** WANs cover larger geographical areas, linking multiple LANs across diverse locations.

## Internet
- The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices, allowing communication and sharing of resources worldwide.

## IP Address
- An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network.
- **Two types of IP address:** IPv4 (32-bit) and IPv6 (128-bit).

## Localhost
- Localhost refers to the loopback address (127.0.0.1), allowing a device to communicate with itself.

## Subnet
- A subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network, allowing for efficient utilization of IP addresses and network resources.

## IPv6 Creation
- IPv6 was created to address the limitations of IPv4, primarily the exhaustion of available IPv4 addresses due to the exponential growth of internet-connected devices.

## TCP/UDP
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two primary transport layer protocols in the OSI model.

## TCP vs. UDP
- **Main difference:** TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented communication with error checking and flow control, while UDP offers simpler, connectionless communication without such features.

## Port
- A port is a logical construct that allows multiple networked services or applications to operate concurrently on a single device.

## Memorization
- **SSH:** Port 22
- **HTTP:** Port 80
- **HTTPS:** Port 443

## Network Device Connectivity
- **Tool/protocol:** Ping is often used to check if a device is connected to a network by sending ICMP echo requests and receiving ICMP echo replies.
