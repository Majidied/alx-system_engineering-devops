**Project: Network Security and Penetration Testing**

**Background Context:**
This project is entirely optional and not mandatory. Engaging in any part of this project will grant you a project grade of over 100% added to your average. However, not participating in this project will not negatively affect your score. It's meant to be an opportunity for those interested to explore network security concepts and penetration testing techniques. Enjoy the learning experience!

**Resources:**
1. Network sniffing: Learn about capturing and analyzing network traffic to gain insights into network activities.
2. ARP spoofing: Understand how ARP spoofing works, which is a technique used to redirect traffic in a network by modifying ARP tables.
3. Connect to SendGridâ€™s SMTP relay using telnet: Explore how to establish connections to SMTP servers, such as SendGrid's, using telnet for testing and troubleshooting.
4. What is Docker and why is it popular?: Learn about Docker, a popular platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers, and its significance in modern software development.
5. Dictionary attack: Understand the concept of a dictionary attack, which involves systematically entering passwords from a pre-compiled list (dictionary) to gain unauthorized access to a system or service.

**Man or Help:**
1. `tcpdump`: Command-line packet analyzer tool for capturing and analyzing network traffic.
2. `hydra`: Network login cracker tool that performs dictionary attacks against various network services.
3. `telnet`: Command-line tool for interacting with remote systems using the Telnet protocol.
4. `docker`: Command-line tool for managing Docker containers and images.

This project offers an opportunity to delve into various aspects of network security, including sniffing, spoofing, testing SMTP relays, understanding containerization with Docker, and exploring password cracking techniques. Have fun exploring these concepts and expanding your knowledge of network security!
